Hey there! I am Suhas Bharadwaj and I dabble in Full stack development. I am currently employed at Cisco System, Bangalore

I love to read and write tech blogs on Distributed systems, devops and full-stack development and architectures

You can find me at these places but the most reliable way to reach me is to send an email. Please note that due to the large influx of email, it might take 2-3 business days for me to reply back.
